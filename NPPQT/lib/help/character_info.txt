*******Infravision
Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the player to see walls and objects.  Infravision will allow a character  to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance past the player's light source, even if the players are invisible.  However, many of Angband's creatures are cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source. All non-human races have innate infra-vision ability.  Humans (including Dúnedain) cannot gain infra-vision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race, magical equipment, and magical items.  1 square = 10 feet.
