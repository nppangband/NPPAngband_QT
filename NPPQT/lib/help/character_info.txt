A high strength helps increase total number of melee blows per round, melee to-hit, melee to damage, player weight carrying capacity, maximum weildable weapon weight, bashing chances, throwing range, and digging capability.  Characters with low strengths may receive penalties in these areas.

*******Intelligence
Intelligence affects the ability of mages and rogues to cast spells, and a druid or ranger's ability to chant incantations.  Intelligence will affect the number of spells or incantations you may learn each level as well as the number of spell points you receive.  A high intelligence also improves your chances of successfully casting a spell or incantations.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.  Characters with low intelligence may receive penalties in these areas.
*******<end>

*******Wisdom
Wisdom affects the ability of a priest or paladin to use prayers, and a druid's or ranger's ability to chant incantations.  High wisdom will increase the number of spell points you have and increase the number of prayers you can learn each level.  A high wisdom also improves the chance that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom can also help to improve your saving throw against magical spells cast upon you by monsters.  Characters with low wisdom may receive penalties in these areas.
*******<end>

*******Dexterity
Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies.  A high dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if the character has a dexterity of 18/150 or greater, thieves will never be successful in stealing from the player.  A high dexterity also reduces the possibilty of the player getting stunned while bashing a door or a creature.  Characters with low dexterity may receive penalties in these areas.
*******<end>

*******Constitution

Therefore a character with a high constitution will receive more hit points and also regenerate them faster.  A high consitutions also affects the player's recovery rate from cuts, poison, and being stunned.  Characters with a low constitution may receive penalties in these areas.
*******<end>

*******Hit Points
When the player's hit points go below zero, the player dies.  The player's maximum hit points are gained when the player levels up or increases their Consitution.  There is also a chance that the Adventurer's Guild will offer to increase the player's maximum hit points as a quest reward.  Unless the player has a dangerous temporary effect (e.g. being poisoned, being cut), the player will regenerate a small amount of hit points each turn.  The player also has the option to rest until their hit points are fully recovered, or use magic to heal themselves.
*******<end>

*******Spell Points
Spell points are required for spellcating classes to cast spells (Mage, Ranger), pray prayers (Priest, Paladin), or chant incantations (Druid, Ranger).  Casting a spell without having sufficient mana can damage the player's health, or cause them to pass out.  Maximum spell points increase as the player levels up, or their primary spell stat increases.  Unless the player has a dangerous temporary effect (e.g. being poisoned, being cut), the player will regenerate a small amount of hit points each turn.  The player also has the option to rest until their hit points are fully recovered.  The player will regenerate a small amount of spell points each turn.  The player also has the option to rest until their spell points are fully recovered, or use magic items to recover spell potions.
*******<end>

*******Fame
The player increases their fame by completing quests, killing uniques, and killing player ghosts.  A high enough player fame  prompts the Adventurer's Guild to offer a wider variety of quests, and greatly increases the variety and quanity of quest rewards.  If the player fails or abandons a quest, the player's fame is sharply decreased.
*******<end>

*******Gold
The player can collect gold found in the dungeon, as a quest reward, as well as by selling object in the town stores.  Gold can be used to purchase items and services in the town shops.

*******<end>

*******Player Current Experience
Total current player experience.  If current experience is less than maximum experience, the player's experience has been drained.  While current experience is less than maximum experience, when the player gainsexperience, the maximum experience increases only 10% of the experience gain until current experience catches up.  There are magical spells and items that can restore a player's experience back to the maximumm level.

After 300,000 game turns have elasped, total score is adjusted downward based on the number of game turns the player has taken.
*******<end>

*******<end>

*******Max Burden
Max weight is the total weight the player can carry without being slowed.
*******<end>

*******Percent Burden
The player is slowed when this percentage exceeds 100%
*******<end>

*******Armor Class
A higher armor class reduces the chance the player being hit by a physical attack.  This includes monster melee attacks, as well as arrows, shots, and bolts.  Usually the character's known armor class is displayed onscreen.  The player's known armor class may vary due to unidentified magical equipment.  Armor class comes from dexterity and equipment.  The format for displaying armor class is: [Intrinsic AC, dexterity and magical bonuses to AC].
*******<end>

*******Infravision
Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the player to see walls and objects.  Infravision will allow a character  to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance past the player's light source, even if the players are invisible.  However, many of Angband's creatures are cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source. All non-human races have innate infra-vision ability.  Humans (including Dúnedain) cannot gain infra-vision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race, magical equipment, and magical items.  1 square = 10 feet.
*******<end>

*******Speed
Speed has a dramatic effect on player power and survivability.  Boots, rings, and weapons that hasten you are rare and powerful. In battle, the one that moves faster has a tremendous advantage, as they will sometimes get to attack their opponent multiple times before their foe gets a turn. There are magical spells that can temporarily speed up or slow down both the player and monsters.  For NPPANgband, the incremental changes in speed have less effect as the extremes are approached.  Normal speed = 1 player turn every 10 game turns.  -7 speed = twice as slow as normal speed  +10 speed = 2x normal speed<br>+20 speed = 3x normal speed<br>+20 speed = 3x normal speed<br>+44 speed = 4x normal speed<br>+70 speed = 4.9x normal speed (maximum achievable speed).  For NPPMoria, Each positive increment doubles player speed.  Each negative increment cuts player speed in half.  (+1)=2x normal speed  (+2)=4x normal speed  (+3)=8x normal speed (-1)= half normal speed.
*******<end>

*******Saving Throw
A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a spell cast at them.  The player gets a saving throw against most monster magical attacks such as fear, paralysis, slowness, blindness, and confusion.  This does not include spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion.  It is based on player race, class, and wisdom.  This ability increases with the level of the character, but then most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even out.  Note some monster attacks do not allow a saving throw, so even a perfect saving throw doesn't offer complete protection from all forms of these attacks.
*******<end>

*******Stealth
The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Characters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.  A high stealth can make the player extremely quiet, but the player cannot achieve perfect silence.
*******<end>

*******Fighting Ability
Fighting Ability is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.  Fighting ability is based on character race and class, and increases with the level of the character.  It is a significant factor in making a weapon attack sucessful, and the chances of getting a critical hit.  Critical hits increase total damage dice and +to-damage, and cause multiple damage rolls with the hightest calculated damage used.  In terms of total damage inflicted, Fighting abiliy is significantly less important than the number of attacks per round, player speed, player to-damage, and the weight of the of weapon the player is wielding.  Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more blows per round with lighter weapons.  A quirk of the combat calculations is that low level fighting classes, even a half-troll warrior, can do more damage in combat getting multiple attacks with a light weapon such as a whip or a dagger than with a heavy weapon such as a broad sword.  In NPPAngband, Warriors get an extra attack when they reach level 26.  More details of the player's ability with a weapon can be found by examining the weapon.
*******<end>

*******Shooting Ability
Shooting abillity is the skill in firing ranged missile weapons (arrows, bolts, and shots) from missile launchers (bows, crossbows, and slings).  It is based on race and class and increases with the level of the character.  It is a significant factor in making a sucessful hit, and for getting a critical hit. Critical hits increase total damage dice and +to-damage, and cause multiple damage rolls with the hightest calculated damage used.  In terms of total damage inflicted, this factor is significantly less important than shooting speed, player speed, bow multiplier, the quality of missile launcher, and the quality of ammunition fired.  It can also increase the maximum distance an object is fired.  In NPPAngband, Rogues, Brigands, and Rangers can get an faster shooting speed with an appropriate missile launcher at level 26.  More details of the player's ability with a missile launcher or ammunition can be found by examining the launcher or the ammunition.
******<end>

*******Throwing Ability
Throwing abillity is the skill in throwing objects at creatues.  It is based on race and class and increases with the level of the character.  It is a significant factor in making a sucessful hit, and for getting a critical hit. Critical hits increase total damage dice and +to-damage, and cause multiple damage rolls with the hightest calculated damage used.  In terms of total damage inflicted, this factor is significantly less important than the qualitiess of the item thrown.  It can also increase the maximum distance an object is fired.  Well balanced weapons can be thrown for more damage than regular weapons.  Some potions can have interesting side effects when thrown.  In NPPAngband, Rogues and brigands get extra damage when throwing a well balanced weapon.  A level 10-15 rogue with an ego item, well-balanced throwing weapon or an artifact throwing weapon can kill most creatures down to 750' with a single throw;
******<end>

*******Disarming
Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful disarming will gain the character some experience.  A trap must be found before it can be disarmed.  Disarming ability is based on player race, class, dexterity, intelligence and player level.
******<end>

*******Magic Device
Magic Device ability is used in determining if the player has sucessfully activated an object, or used a wand, rod, or staff.  Spell users such as mages, druids and priests are therefore much better at using a magical device than say a warrior.  It is based on player race, class, intelligence, and level.  Object or atifact level also factors into the equation of whether the object has been sucessfully used.
